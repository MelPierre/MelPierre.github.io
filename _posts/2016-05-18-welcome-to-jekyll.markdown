This feature helps you manage multiple accounts from Gmail; it works only if you already have access to the email account linked to the alternate address.

- Sign in to your Google Apps email.
- Click the  in the upper-right and select Settings along the top of any page, and select the Accounts tab.
- Under Send mail as, click Add another email address.
- In the Email address field, enter your name and alternate email address.
- Click Next Step >> and then click Send Verification. Gmail will send a verification message to your other email address to confirm that you own it.
- Locate the message from Gmail. Open it and and either click the link contained in the message or enter the confirmation code in the Accounts section of your Google Apps email settings.

Messages you send will appear to be from the domain alias or email alias.
